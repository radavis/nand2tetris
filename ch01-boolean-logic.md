## Boolean Logic

![Boolean Functions](images/boolean_functions.png)

Every digital device is built from the same building blocks: elementary logic gates (which consist of transistors). We can use the __Nand gate__ to construct every other logic gate.

### Implementation of a gate in HDL

Fully testing individual chips is important. Fully testing more complex systems with 100% certainty is not feasible.
